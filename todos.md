navbar header needs to be a responsive size, navbar just generally does weird stuff when the window size changes
how to get the border radius of bootstrap nav to behave correctly
how do you get spacing between grid elements..??
getting the footer to stay at the gd bottom!!
need indication of what tab we're on - nav link active setting

update colors!
get link elements to stop freaking underlining all the time
get some groovier fonts going

***would be great to get some animations going, like:
--zoom on planet image on hover
--get planet name to hide and then appear when hovered over

**need something to handle default landing page if page isn't found



**will need to clean up html tags/classes/ids, css style doc - lots of extraneous stuff in there

add other images for the campuses
